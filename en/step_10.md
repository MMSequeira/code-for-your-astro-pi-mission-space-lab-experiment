## User input

Your code should not rely on human input via the joystick or buttons. Since the crew will not have time to manually operate the Astro Pi, the experiments cannot depend on human input. For example, if an experiment needs a button pressed by an astronaut to begin, that button press will never happen and the experiment will not run for three hours. This is also why experiments on the crew, like human reaction speed or memory tests, are not suitable experiments.
