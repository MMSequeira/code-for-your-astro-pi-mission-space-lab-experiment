## What you will need

### Hardware

+ Raspberry Pi
+ Sense HAT


### Software

You will need the Astro Pi 2018 version of Raspbian which already includes the following software packages:

+ Python 3
+ Sense HAT for Python
+ ephem python library
+ logzero python library

For testing, you should use the Flight OS version of Raspbian.  This is a special build of the Raspbian operating system, optimised to run on the ISS Astro Pis. It does not include any X-Windows or GUI applications and is *"command line"* only, so is not really a useful platform for actually writing your code and developing on. However, you should test your experiment using this version prior to submitting your entry.

### Additional Resources

+ If you want to, you can [make a 3D printed flight case](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/astro-pi-flight-case){:target="_blank"}, and use this for even more realistic testing of the onboard ISS experience. However this is not a requirement and you can enter Mission Space Lab without building a replica Flight Case.
