## Test your program

Before you submit your program, it is vital that you test it using an Astro Pi running the sample Flight OS (operating system), which we will provide to you, to make sure it works as expected on this OS. It’s also important to consider any errors that could occur during your program’s run on the on-board Astro Pis’ Flight OS, such as file path errors or overwriting of files. Hundreds of teams submit programs to the challenge each year and, unfortunately, we do not have the capacity to debug complex code errors: if your program fails to run without errors when we test it on the sample Flight OS, your team will not progress to Phase 3. So to ensure that your entry has the best chance of success, thoroughly test your program, debug any errors, and check it against the coding requirements. The security of the International Space Station is of vital importance, and any programs that fail to follow the coding requirements will not receive flight status
