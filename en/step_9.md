## Networking

For security reasons, **your program is not allowed to access the network on the ISS**. It should not attempt to open a socket, call out to the internet, or make a network connection of any kind. This includes local network connections back to the Astro Pi itself. As part of testing your program, you should disable wireless connectivity and unplug the Ethernet cable from your Pi to make sure that your experiment runs successfully without an internet connection.
