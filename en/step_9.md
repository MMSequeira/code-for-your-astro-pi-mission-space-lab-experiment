## Networking

For security reasons, student programs are not allowed to access the network on the ISS. Your code should not attempt to open a socket, call out to the Internet, or make a network connection of any kind. This includes local network connections back to the Astro Pi itself.  As part of testing your code you should disable WiFi and Ethernet unplug the network cable from your Pi to make sure that your experiment runs without an Internet connection.
