## Introduction

The European Astro Pi Challenge is run in collaboration with the European Space Agency.  It offers young people the amazing opportunity to conduct scientific investigations in space by writing computer programs that run on Raspberry Pi computers - the Astro Pis - aboard the International Space Station.

This guide covers Phase 2 of the competition and contains information on assembling your kit, coding your experiment, and testing your program. This guide also includes essential details of what is and isn’t possible with the Astro Pi hardware and software.


This guide covers both Mission Space Lab themes: Life on Earth and Life in Space.

### What you will make

We want your experiment to run reliably on the ISS  and so this year we have published a guide to help you get started quickly and have the best chance of running without problems.

We don’t insist that you follow every rule, but if you’re think you need to do things differently, please get in touch before submitting your entry.  Code which does not follow these guidelines will score less highly during the judging process than a program that does, and may not progress to the next phase if it cannot be run easily as on the ISS without modification.   

If you’ve entered the Astro Pi competition before, please make sure you read and follow this guide, as many things have changed from previous years.

### Hardware

+ Raspberry Pi
+ Sense HAT

### Software

You will need the Astro Pi 2018 version of Raspbian which already includes the following software packages:

+ Python 3
+ Sense HAT for Python
+ ephem python library
+ logzero python library

For testing, you should use the Flight OS version of Raspbian.  This is a special build of the Raspbian operating system, optimised to run on the ISS Astro Pis. It does not include any X-Windows or GUI applications and is *"command line"* only, so is not really a useful platform for actually writing your code and developing on. However, you should test your experiment using this version prior to submitting your entry.

### Additional Resources

+ If you want to, you can [make a 3D printed flight case](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/astro-pi-flight-case){:target="_blank"}, and use this for even more realistic testing of the onboard ISS experience. However this is not a requirement and you can enter Mission Space Lab without building a replica Flight Case.
