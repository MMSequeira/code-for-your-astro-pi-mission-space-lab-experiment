## Introduction

The European Astro Pi Challenge is run in collaboration with the European Space Agency.  It offers young people the amazing opportunity to conduct scientific investigations in space by writing computer programs that run on Raspberry Pi computers - the Astro Pis - aboard the International Space Station.

This guide covers Phase 2 of the competition and contains information on assembling your kit, coding your experiment, and testing your program. This guide also includes essential details of what is and isn’t possible with the Astro Pi hardware and software.


This guide covers both Mission Space Lab themes: Life on Earth and Life in Space.

### What you will make

We want your experiment to run reliably on the ISS  and so this year we have published a guide to help you get started quickly and have the best chance of running without problems.

We don’t insist that you follow every rule, but if you’re think you need to do things differently, please get in touch before submitting your entry.  Code which does not follow these guidelines will score less highly during the judging process than a program that does, and may not progress to the next phase if it cannot be run easily as on the ISS without modification.   

If you’ve entered the Astro Pi competition before, please make sure you read and follow this guide, as many things have changed from previous years.
