## Getting started

### Which version of Python should you use?

All Mission Space Lab (MSL) entries must be written in Python 3.

If you find a Python library that you need for your experiment that is Python 2 only, please contact us and we will help you find an alternative approach.

### Using additional Python libraries

Some Python libraries may include functions that perform a web request to look-up some information or return a value that is dependent on time or location. Even though they may be very useful, these are not permitted (see Networking section below).  

### Using the Sense HAT

If you've never used the Sense HAT before, [start with this project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat/) first, then come back here once you've mastered the basic Sense HAT concepts.

### What to call your Mission Space Lab code files

When you submit your MSL experimental code, your main Python code file should be called astropi_main.py

Ideally, all you code should be contained within this file. However, if your experiment is very complex, then additional code files are allowed.

### Documenting your code

When youâ€™ve created a really useful project and you want to share it with other people, a crucial step is creating documentation that helps people understand what the code does, how it works, and how they can use it. This is especially import for your MSL experiment where it should be clear from your code how you are achieving your aims and objectives.

This [project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/documenting-your-code) shows you the recommended way to add useful comments to your code.
