## Getting started

### Which version of Python should you use?

All Mission Space Lab (MSL) entries must be written in Python 3.

If you find a Python library that you need for your experiment that is Python 2 only, please contact us and we will help you find an alternative approach.

### Using the Sense HAT

[[[rpi-sensehat-attach]]]

If you've never used the Sense HAT before, [start with this project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat/) first, then come back here once you've mastered the basic Sense HAT concepts.

### What to call your Mission Space Lab code files

When you submit your MSL experimental code, your main Python code file should be called astropi_main.py

Ideally, all you code should be contained within this file. However, if your experiment is very complex, then additional code files are allowed.
